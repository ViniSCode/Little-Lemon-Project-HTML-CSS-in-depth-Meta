# Little Lemon Landing Page

This is a project that I developed as part of the Meta Front End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera (HTML and CSS in depth). The idea was to create a landing page for a fictitious client, in my case, Little Lemon, a restaurant that serves healthy and delicious food.

I built this page using only HTML and CSS, using everything I learned throughout the course. The design is clean and simple, with a soft color scheme and attractive images.

In addition, I made sure to apply good accessibility and responsiveness practices, ensuring that the page is easy to navigate on different devices and for everyone.

I hope this project can be an inspiration to other front-end developers, especially those who are just starting out. Feel free to check out my work and, if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
